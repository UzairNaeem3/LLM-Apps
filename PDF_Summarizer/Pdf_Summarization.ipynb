      "hasn’t glanced at me,’ Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The \n",
      "sunlight was bright in the room; the incense rose in clouds; \n",
      "the priest read, ‘Give rest, oh Lord….’ Raskolnikov stayed \n",
      "all through the service. As he blessed them and took his \n",
      "leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service, \n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and \n",
      "let her head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly ges -\n",
      "ture bewildered Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that \n",
      "there was no trace of repugnance, no trace of disgust, no \n",
      "tremor in her hand. It was the furthest limit of self-abnega -\n",
      "tion, at least so he interpreted it.\n",
      "Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and \n",
      "went out. He felt very miserable. If it had been possible to \n",
      "escape to some solitude, he would have thought himself \n",
      "lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life there. But al -\n",
      "though he had almost always been by himself of late, he \n",
      "had never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out \n",
      "of the town on to the high road, once he had even reached \n",
      "a little wood, but the lonelier the place was, the more he \n",
      "seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near him. It did \n",
      "not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he made \n",
      "haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to \n",
      "enter restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thorough -\n",
      "fares. There he felt easier and even more solitary. One day \n",
      "at dusk he sat for an hour listening to songs in a tavern and \n",
      "he remembered that he positively enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again, as though his \n",
      "conscience smote him. ‘Here I sit listening to singing, is that \n",
      "what I ought to be doing?’ he thought. Yet he felt at once \n",
      "that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was \n",
      "something requiring immediate decision, but it was some -\n",
      "thing he could not clearly understand or put into words. It \n",
      "was a hopeless tangle. ‘No, better the struggle again! Better \n",
      "Porfiry again … or Svidrigaïlov…. Better some challenge \n",
      "again … some attack. Yes, yes!’ he thought. He went out of \n",
      "the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of \n",
      "Dounia and his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a \n",
      "panic. That night he woke up before morning among some \n",
      "bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling all over with fever; \n",
      "he walked home, and it was early morning when he arrived. \n",
      "After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up \n",
      "late, two o’clock in the afternoon.\n",
      "He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had \n",
      "been fixed for that day, and was glad that he was not pres -\n",
      "ent at it. Nastasya brought him some food; he ate and drank \n",
      "with appetite, almost with greediness. His head was fresh -\n",
      "er and he was calmer than he had been for the last three \n",
      "days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks \n",
      "of panic.\n",
      "The door opened and Razumihin came in.\n",
      "‘Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,’ said Razumihin. He took \n",
      "a chair and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\n",
      "He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He \n",
      "spoke with evident annoyance, but without hurry or rais -\n",
      "ing his voice. He looked as though he had some special fixed determination.\n",
      "‘Listen,’ he began resolutely. ‘As far as I am concerned, \n",
      "you may all go to hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me \n",
      "that I can’t make head or tail of it; please don’t think I’ve \n",
      "come to ask you questions. I don’t want to know, hang it! If \n",
      "you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say I shouldn’t stay \n",
      "to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come to find \n",
      "out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There \n",
      "is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. \n",
      "I admit I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging \n",
      "from your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, \n",
      "and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister. \n",
      "Only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; \n",
      "so you must be mad.’\n",
      "‘When did you see them last?’\n",
      "‘Just now. Haven’t you seen them since then? What have \n",
      "you been doing with yourself? Tell me, please. I’ve been to \n",
      "you three times already. Your mother has been seriously ill \n",
      "since yesterday. She had made up her mind to come to you; \n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she wouldn’t hear \n",
      "a word. ‘If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can look af -\n",
      "ter him like his mother?’ she said. We all came here together, \n",
      "we couldn’t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging \n",
      "her to be calm. We came in, you weren’t here; she sat down, \n",
      "and stayed ten minutes, while we stood waiting in silence. \n",
      "She got up and said: ‘If he’s gone out, that is, if he is well, and \n",
      "has forgotten his mother, it’s humiliating and unseemly for \n",
      "his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness.’ She \n",
      "returned home and took to her bed; now she is in a fever. ‘I see,’ she said, ‘that he has time for his girl . ‘ She means by \n",
      "your girl  Sofya Semyonovna, your betrothed or your mis -\n",
      "tress, I don’t know. I went at once to Sofya Semyonovna’s, \n",
      "for I wanted to know what was going on. I looked round, I \n",
      "saw the coffin, the children crying, and Sofya Semyonovna \n",
      "trying them on mourning dresses. No sign of you. I apol -\n",
      "ogised, came away, and reported to Avdotya Romanovna. \n",
      "So that’s all nonsense and you haven’t got a girl; the most \n",
      "likely thing is that you are mad. But here you sit, guzzling \n",
      "boiled beef as though you’d not had a bite for three days. \n",
      "Though as far as that goes, madmen eat too, but though you \n",
      "have not said a word to me yet … you are not mad! That I’d \n",
      "swear! Above all, you are not mad! So you may go to hell, all \n",
      "of you, for there’s some mystery, some secret about it, and \n",
      "I don’t intend to worry my brains over your secrets. So I’ve \n",
      "simply come to swear at you,’ he finished, getting up, ‘to re -\n",
      "lieve my mind. And I know what to do now.’\n",
      "‘What do you mean to do now?’\n",
      "‘What business is it of yours what I mean to do?’\n",
      "‘You are going in for a drinking bout.’\n",
      "‘How … how did you know?’\n",

      "before yesterday?’ Razumihin stopped short and even \n",
      "turned a little pale.\n",
      "One could see that his heart was throbbing slowly and \n",
      "violently.\n",
      "‘She came here by herself, sat there and talked to me.’\n",
      "‘She did!’\n",
      "‘Yes.’\n",
      "‘What did you say to her … I mean, about me?’\n",
      "‘I told her you were a very good, honest, and industrious \n",

      "herself.’\n",
      "‘She knows that herself?’\n",
      "‘Well, it’s pretty plain. Wherever I might go, whatever \n",
      "happened to me, you would remain to look after them. I, \n",
      "so to speak, give them into your keeping, Razumihin. I say \n",
      "this because I know quite well how you love her, and am \n",
      "convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too \n",
      "may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now de -\n",
      "cide for yourself, as you know best, whether you need go in \n",
      "for a drinking bout or not.’\n",
      "‘Rodya! You see … well…. Ach, damn it! But where do \n",
      "you mean to go? Of course, if it’s all a secret, never mind…. \n",
      "But I … I shall find out the secret … and I am sure that it \n",
      "must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you’ve made it \n",
      "all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a capital fellow! …’\n",
      "‘That was just what I wanted to add, only you interrupted, \n",
      "that that was a very good decision of yours not to find out \n",
      "these secrets. Leave it to time, don’t worry about it. You’ll know it all in time when it must be. Yesterday a man said \n",
      "to me that what a man needs is fresh air, fresh air, fresh air. \n",
      "I mean to go to him directly to find out what he meant by \n",
      "that.’\n",
      "Razumihin stood lost in thought and excitement, mak -\n",
      "ing a silent conclusion.\n",
      "‘He’s a political conspirator! He must be. And he’s on \n",
      "the eve of some desperate step, that’s certain. It can only be \n",
      "that! And … and Dounia knows,’ he thought suddenly.\n",
      "‘So Avdotya Romanovna comes to see you,’ he said, \n",
      "weighing each syllable, ‘and you’re going to see a man who \n",
      "says we need more air, and so of course that letter … that \n",
      "too must have something to do with it,’ he concluded to \n",
      "himself.\n",
      "‘What letter?’\n",
      "‘She got a letter to-day. It upset her very much—very \n",
      "much indeed. Too much so. I began speaking of you, she \n",
      "begged me not to. Then … then she said that perhaps we \n",
      "should very soon have to part … then she began warmly \n",
      "thanking me for something; then she went to her room and \n",
      "locked herself in.’\n",
      "‘She got a letter?’ Raskolnikov asked thoughtfully.\n",
      "‘Yes, and you didn’t know? hm …’\n",
      "They were both silent.\n",
      "‘Good-bye, Rodion. There was a time, brother, when I…. \n",
      "Never mind, good-bye. You see, there was a time…. Well, \n",
      "good-bye! I must be off too. I am not going to drink. There’s \n",
      "no need now…. That’s all stuff!’\n",
      "He hurried out; but when he had almost closed the door behind him, he suddenly opened it again, and said, look -\n",
      "ing away:\n",
      "‘Oh, by the way, do you remember that murder, you know \n",
      "Porfiry’s, that old woman? Do you know the murderer has \n",
      "been found, he has confessed and given the proofs. It’s one \n",
      "of those very workmen, the painter, only fancy! Do you re -\n",
      "member I defended them here? Would you believe it, all \n",
      "that scene of fighting and laughing with his companions on \n",
      "the stairs while the porter and the two witnesses were going \n",
      "up, he got up on purpose to disarm suspicion. The cunning, \n",
      "the presence of mind of the young dog! One can hardly \n",
      "credit it; but it’s his own explanation, he has confessed it all. \n",
      "And what a fool I was about it! Well, he’s simply a genius \n",
      "of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspi -\n",
      "cions of the lawyers—so there’s nothing much to wonder \n",
      "at, I suppose! Of course people like that are always possible. \n",
      "And the fact that he couldn’t keep up the character, but con -\n",
      "fessed, makes him easier to believe in. But what a fool I was! \n",
      "I was frantic on their side!’\n",
      "‘Tell me, please, from whom did you hear that, and why \n",
      "does it interest you so?’ Raskolnikov asked with unmistak -\n",
      "able agitation.\n",
      "‘What next? You ask me why it interests me! … Well, I \n",
      "heard it from Porfiry, among others … It was from him I \n",
      "heard almost all about it.’\n",
      "‘From Porfiry?’\n",
      "‘From Porfiry.’\n",
      "‘What … what did he say?’ Raskolnikov asked in dismay.\n",
      "‘He gave me a capital explanation of it. Psychologically, after his fashion.’\n",
      "‘He explained it? Explained it himself?’\n",
      "‘Yes, yes; good-bye. I’ll tell you all about it another time, \n",
      "but now I’m busy. There was a time when I fancied … But \n",
      "no matter, another time! … What need is there for me to \n",
      "drink now? You have made me drunk without wine. I am \n",
      "drunk, Rodya! Good-bye, I’m going. I’ll come again very \n",
      "soon.’\n",
      "He went out.\n",
      "‘He’s a political conspirator, there’s not a doubt about \n",
      "it,’ Razumihin decided, as he slowly descended the stairs. \n",
      "‘And he’s drawn his sister in; that’s quite, quite in keeping \n",
      "with Avdotya Romanovna’s character. There are interviews \n",
      "between them! … She hinted at it too … So many of her \n",
      "words…. and hints … bear that meaning! And how else can \n",
      "all this tangle be explained? Hm! And I was almost think -\n",
      "ing … Good heavens, what I thought! Yes, I took leave of my \n",
      "senses and I wronged him! It was his doing, under the lamp \n",
      "in the corridor that day. Pfoo! What a crude, nasty, vile idea \n",
      "on my part! Nikolay is a brick, for confessing…. And how \n",
      "clear it all is now! His illness then, all his strange actions \n",
      "… before this, in the university, how morose he used to be, \n",
      "how gloomy…. But what’s the meaning now of that letter? \n",
      "There’s something in that, too, perhaps. Whom was it from? \n",
      "I suspect …! No, I must find out!’\n",
      "He thought of Dounia, realising all he had heard and his \n",
      "heart throbbed, and he suddenly broke into a run.\n",
      "As soon as Razumihin went out, Raskolnikov got up, \n",
      "turned to the window, walked into one corner and then into another, as though forgetting the smallness of his room, and \n",
      "sat down again on the sofa. He felt, so to speak, renewed; \n",
      "again the struggle, so a means of escape had come.\n",
      "‘Yes, a means of escape had come! It had been too sti -\n",
      "fling, too cramping, the burden had been too agonising. A \n",
      "lethargy had come upon him at times. From the moment of \n",
      "the scene with Nikolay at Porfiry’s he had been suffocating, \n",
      "penned in without hope of escape. After Nikolay’s confes -\n",
      "sion, on that very day had come the scene with Sonia; his \n",
      "behaviour and his last words had been utterly unlike any -\n",
      "thing he could have imagined beforehand; he had grown \n",
      "feebler, instantly and fundamentally! And he had agreed at \n",
      "the time with Sonia, he had agreed in his heart he could not \n",
      "go on living alone with such a thing on his mind!\n",
      "‘And Svidrigaïlov was a riddle … He worried him, that \n",
      "was true, but somehow not on the same point. He might \n",
      "still have a struggle to come with Svidrigaïlov. Svidrigaïlov, \n",
      "too, might be a means of escape; but Porfiry was a different \n",
      "matter.\n",
      "‘And so Porfiry himself had explained it to Razumihin, \n",
      "had explained it psychologically . He had begun bringing in \n",
      "his damned psychology again! Porfiry? But to think that \n",
      "Porfiry should for one moment believe that Nikolay was \n",
      "guilty, after what had passed between them before Nikolay’s \n",
      "appearance, after that tête-à-tête interview, which could \n",
      "have only one explanation? (During those days Raskolnikov \n",
      "had often recalled passages in that scene with Porfiry; he \n",
      "could not bear to let his mind rest on it.) Such words, such \n",
      "gestures had passed between them, they had exchanged such glances, things had been said in such a tone and had \n",
      "reached such a pass, that Nikolay, whom Porfiry had seen \n",
      "through at the first word, at the first gesture, could not have \n",
      "shaken his conviction.\n",
      "‘And to think that even Razumihin had begun to suspect! \n",
      "The scene in the corridor under the lamp had produced its \n",
      "effect then. He had rushed to Porfiry…. But what had in -\n",
      "duced the latter to receive him like that? What had been \n",
      "his object in putting Razumihin off with Nikolay? He must \n",
      "have some plan; there was some design, but what was it? It \n",
      "was true that a long time had passed since that morning—\n",
      "too long a time—and no sight nor sound of Porfiry. Well, \n",
      "that was a bad sign….’\n",
      "Raskolnikov took his cap and went out of the room, still \n",
      "pondering. It was the first time for a long while that he had \n",
      "felt clear in his mind, at least. ‘I must settle Svidrigaïlov,’ he \n",
      "thought, ‘and as soon as possible; he, too, seems to be wait -\n",
      "ing for me to come to him of my own accord.’ And at that \n",
      "moment there was such a rush of hate in his weary heart \n",
      "that he might have killed either of those two—Porfiry or \n",
      "Svidrigaïlov. At least he felt that he would be capable of do -\n",
      "ing it later, if not now.\n",
      "‘We shall see, we shall see,’ he repeated to himself.\n",
      "But no sooner had he opened the door than he stumbled \n",
      "upon Porfiry himself in the passage. He was coming in to \n",
      "see him. Raskolnikov was dumbfounded for a minute, but \n",
      "only for one minute. Strange to say, he was not very much \n",
      "astonished at seeing Porfiry and scarcely afraid of him. He \n",
      "was simply startled, but was quickly, instantly, on his guard. ‘Perhaps this will mean the end? But how could Porfiry have \n",
      "approached so quietly, like a cat, so that he had heard noth -\n",
      "ing? Could he have been listening at the door?’\n",
      "‘You didn’t expect a visitor, Rodion Romanovitch,’ Por -\n",
      "firy explained, laughing. ‘I’ve been meaning to look in a \n",
      "long time; I was passing by and thought why not go in for \n",
      "five minutes. Are you going out? I won’t keep you long. Just \n",
      "let me have one cigarette.’\n",
      "‘Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.’ Raskolnikov gave \n",

      "seen it.\n",
      "The last moment had come, the last drops had to be \n",
      "drained! So a man will sometimes go through half an hour \n",

      "throat at last, he feels no fear.\n",
      "Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and \n",
      "looked at him without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his \n",
      "eyes and began lighting a cigarette.\n",

      "Translator’s Preface\n",
      "A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the Eng -\n",
      "lish reader to understand his work.\n",
      "Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were \n",
      "very hard- working and deeply religious people, but so poor \n",
      "that they lived with their five children in only two rooms. \n",
      "The father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud \n",
      "to their children, generally from books of a serious charac -\n",
      "ter.\n",
      "Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out \n",
      "third in the final examination of the Petersburg school of \n",
      "Engineering. There he had already begun his first work, \n",
      "‘Poor Folk.’\n",
      "This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his \n",
      "review and was received with acclamations. The shy, un -\n",
      "known youth found himself instantly something of a \n",
      "celebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open \n",
      "before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he \n",
      "was arrested.\n",
      "Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolu -\n",
      "tionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men \n",
      "who met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was ac -\n",
      "cused of ‘taking part in conversations against the censorship, \n",
      "of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing \n",
      "of the intention to set up a printing press.’ Under Nicholas I.(that ‘stern and just man,’ as Maurice Baring calls him) this \n",
      "was enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight \n",
      "months’ imprisonment he was with twenty-one others tak -\n",
      "en out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his \n",
      "brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: ‘They snapped words over \n",
      "our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by \n",
      "persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in \n",
      "threes to stakes, to suffer execution. Being the third in the \n",
      "row, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. \n",
      "I thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss \n",
      "Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid \n",
      "them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were \n",
      "unbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed \n",
      "that his Majesty had spared us our lives.’ The sentence was \n",
      "commuted to hard labour.\n",
      "One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he \n",
      "was untied, and never regained his sanity.\n",
      "The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting \n",
      "stamp on Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper \n",
      "led him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation \n",
      "and to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly \n",
      "recurs to the subject in his writings. He describes the awful \n",
      "agony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of \n",
      "inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal \n",
      "servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in \n",
      "Siberia, where he began the ‘Dead House,’ and some years \n",
      "of service in a disciplinary battalion.\n",
      "He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease be -\n",
      "fore his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks ofepilepsy, from which he suffered for the rest of his life. The \n",
      "fits occurred three or four times a year and were more fre -\n",
      "quent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was allowed to \n",
      "return to Russia. He started a journal— ‘Vremya,’ which was \n",
      "forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. \n",
      "In 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was \n",
      "in terrible poverty, yet he took upon himself the payment \n",
      "of his brother’s debts. He started another journal—‘The Ep -\n",
      "och,’ which within a few months was also prohibited. He \n",
      "was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was depen -\n",
      "dent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, \n",
      "and is said never to have corrected his work. The later years \n",
      "of his life were much softened by the tenderness and devo -\n",
      "tion of his second wife.\n",
      "In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveil -\n",
      "ing of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was \n",
      "received with extraordinary demonstrations of love and \n",
      "honour.\n",
      "A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to \n",
      "the grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who ‘gave the \n",
      "hapless man the funeral of a king.’ He is still probably the \n",
      "most widely read writer in Russia.\n",
      "In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the \n",
      "feeling inspired by Dostoevsky: ‘He was one of ourselves, a \n",
      "man of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered \n",
      "and has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight \n",
      "impresses us as wisdom … that wisdom of the heart which \n",
      "we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other \n",
