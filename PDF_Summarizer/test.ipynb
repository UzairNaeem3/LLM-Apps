      "Tfoo! You know I am not going to Porfiry, I am sick of him. \n",
      "I’d rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise him, what a sensation I shall make! But I \n",

      "Ah! what am I coming to! Well, where are the crosses?’\n",

      "after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll be my nurse.’\n",

      "he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he was cer -\n",

      "was frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the \n",
      "thought that Sonia meant to go with him.\n",
      "‘What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, \n",
      "stay! I’ll go alone,’ he cried in cowardly vexation, and al -\n",
      "most resentful, he moved towards the door. ‘What’s the use \n",
      "of going in procession?’ he muttered going out.\n",
      "Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He \n",
      "had not even said good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A \n",
      "poignant and rebellious doubt surged in his heart.\n",
      "‘Was it right, was it right, all this?’ he thought again as \n",
      "he went down the stairs. ‘Couldn’t he stop and retract it all \n",
      "… and not go?’\n",
      "But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he \n",

      "he remembered that he had not said good-bye to Sonia, that \n",
      "he had left her in the middle of the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted at her, and he stopped \n",
      "short for a moment. At the same instant, another thought \n",

      "strike him then.\n",
      "‘Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told \n",
      "her—on business; on what business? I had no sort of busi -\n",
      "ness! To tell her I was going ; but where was the need? Do I \n",

      "tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart ached! \n",
      "I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, \n",
